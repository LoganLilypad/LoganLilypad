# Hi I'm Logan ðŸ‘‹
I like to code and tinker around with whatever I find interesting

## About me

- Currently working on small concepts, usually involving physics and/or math
- Currently wanting to learn the basics of TensorFlow
- The languages I know are Python, Javascript (+NodeJS), and PHP

Feel free to ask about all the projects I have not completed :rofl:
